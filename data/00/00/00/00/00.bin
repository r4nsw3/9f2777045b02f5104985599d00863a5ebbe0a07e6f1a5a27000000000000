  |   Minaduki Kashou leaves a family-run traditional Japanese sweets       |
  |   (Wagashi) shop and opens his own cake shop, "La Soleil", as           |
  |   patissier.                                                            |

  |   However, inside the luggage sent from the house was a mixture of      |
  |   human look-alike Nekos, Chocola and Vanilla.                          |
  |                                                                         |
